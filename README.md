ENG: Codes for university course "Digital Image Processing" <br> <br>

Digital Image Processing is a semester university course focusing on manipulating images using computational techniques. In this repository, Python is used to implement various exercises related to image processing. Each task explores different aspects of image manipulation, including converting between color spaces like RGB and YIQ, performing arithmetic operations on images, histogram equalization, Fourier Transform, convolution filters, morphological operations, resampling, reconstruction, quantization, binarization, and advanced techniques like Marching Squares and "Magic Wand" color fill. Explore the exercises to deepen your understanding of digital image processing concepts and algorithms through hands-on Python implementations.
